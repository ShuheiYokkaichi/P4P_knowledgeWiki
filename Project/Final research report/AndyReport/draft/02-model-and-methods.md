# Part 2 — Model, methods and numerical assessment

## 3. Model and methods

The investigation developed the inlet, liquid-collection and wall-film treatments needed to examine how incoming liquid moves towards removal. Numerical assessment tested what each treatment enabled and whether its outputs supported comparisons of separator behaviour. This work addresses the modelling and numerical parts of the broader validation gap identified in the literature review; physical validation was not completed. Performance measures have distinct definitions: outlet dryness describes steam-outlet composition, whereas liquid-capture efficiency uses incoming liquid as its basis. In the Section 2.2 example, 100 t/h of steam with 5 kg/h of liquid implies approximately 99.995% outlet dryness; those two flows alone do not establish the fraction of incoming liquid captured. The published term “separator efficiency” in that example is therefore not used as an interchangeable measure of liquid capture here.

Ansys Fluent 2025 R2 was used for the CFD calculations. Historical comparison data and their provenance are described in Appendix G.4.

### 3.1. Investigation design and computational domains

The investigation addressed five linked questions: whether the reconstructed model supplied a reliable baseline; how the imposed inlet distribution affected retention; whether numerical collection and staged loading improved the solution; whether wall-film transport supplied a drainage route; and what still limited performance predictions. Continuing inventory and pressure changes made liquid removal a prerequisite for interpreting inlet effects. Two approaches were explored: resolving the lower vessel and brine outlet, and removing liquid numerically near the assumed water level. The main results focus on the inlet, numerical-collector and wall-film comparisons. Appendix F gives the detailed resolved-outlet investigation, and Appendix G retains supporting development, mesh and runtime studies. These were related configurations, not one simulation carried through every test. Where possible, paired tests started from the same saved field to assess the selected change.

The truncated vessel ended near the assumed water level and initially had only a steam outlet. Numerical collectors later removed liquid from its lower region by subtracting mass within selected cells. This represented withdrawal without resolving a physical discharge pipe. Full-geometry calculations instead retained the lower vessel and brine pipe, either closing the brine face while testing a collector or opening it for resolved drainage. Table 1 distinguishes these representations. Neither a sink nor a prescribed outlet pressure was calibrated against operating-plant drainage data.

| **Model family** | **Liquid representation and removal** | **Comparison purpose** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Truncated inlet reconstruction | Mixture carrier; optional DPM; initially no continuous-liquid drain | Inlet distribution, mesh development and particle tracking |
| Truncated collector and film | Mixture carrier with liquid-only sink; optional EWF and direct film drain | Startup, wall routing, film transport and removal |
| Full geometry with collector | Mixture carrier; lower liquid source; brine face closed | Source strength and steady conservation |
| Full geometry with open drain | Mixture or VOF; specified brine pressure/resistance; optional inventory feedback | Outlet response, pool development and startup |
| Single-inlet reconstruction | Recovered carrier/DPM settings on poly-hexcore and tetrahedral meshes | Conditional historical reproduction and computational cost |

*Table 1. Model families and the questions each can address.*

Figure 5 shows representative truncated and full-vessel geometries. The displayed truncated case predates the collectors. The full-vessel view has its brine face closed; this face was opened in the separate resolved-drain studies. Colours identify geometry, not liquid distribution or pool level. Bulk collectors remove mass from selected lower cells; the separate film drain acts on a lower wall segment. Neither numerical sink resolves a physical brine discharge. Table D.2 records their dimensions and case-specific coordinates. The truncation datums and source extents differ between mesh families and must not be transferred between them without checking the geometry.

### 3.2. Inlets, phase models and material assumptions

The models distinguished bulk flow in the vessel, droplets moving through that flow, and a thin liquid layer on the walls. The Mixture model represented interpenetrating liquid and vapour within each cell; VOF represented the liquid pool and its interface with vapour. DPM tracked droplets through the bulk flow, while EWF represented liquid transport along wall surfaces. These descriptions could be combined only with explicit accounting for transfers between them.

The imposed stratified inlet placed liquid along the outer inlet wall and vapour in the remaining region. The inlet boundary was divided into faces supplying only liquid and faces supplying only vapour, with phase flow rates and meshed areas defining the imposed velocities. Earlier variants supplied liquid over half of the inlet; mixed single-inlet reconstructions supplied both phases through one boundary. These were separate configurations. This arrangement represented an assumed incoming liquid distribution; no upstream pipe calculation established a developed stratified flow or a wider flow-regime map.

Steady Mixture calculations used vapour as the primary phase and liquid as the secondary phase. They solved bulk continuity, mixture momentum and liquid volume fraction, with algebraic slip for relative motion. RNG $k$–$\varepsilon$ with standard wall functions provided the main RANS closure; turbulence-model alternatives remained distinct tests.

The resolved-pool branch used VOF to represent the liquid–vapour interface. Its full-geometry assumptions, fixed properties and boundary conditions are retained with the outlet investigation in Appendix F. They must not be transferred to the truncated film or reconstructed particle configurations without checking the case definition.

### 3.3. Meshes and comparison controls

The historical seven-mesh study contained 1.69–13.37 million cells. Later film studies used approximately 60k–2.6M cells, while the single-inlet family spanned 357,145–5,479,605 cells.

Early reconstruction work used an inherited tetrahedral model based on Purnanto et al. (2013) to reconstruct the operating conditions and compare provisional outlet-dryness estimates with the published results. The separator geometry was subsequently remeshed using poly-hexcore cells to reduce the cost of repeated calculations. The selected mesh contained 946,967 cells, compared with 2,964,593 tetrahedral cells, and was intended to represent the same fluid domain. Lower computational cost motivated this choice; a later same-computer benchmark quantified the runtime reduction for the tested cases (Section 5.5). Mesh independence remained a separate requirement and was not established. Appendix G.4 gives the output and runtime comparisons and their limitations; Appendix D records the remaining mesh-construction limits.

Cell count and node count describe different aspects of a mesh. Nodes define its geometry, while cells define the finite-volume control volumes. Fluent stores the main flow variables at cell centres (Ansys, 2025a), so node count is not a direct count of those unknowns. Cells share nodes differently in tetrahedral and poly-hexcore meshes; neither equal node counts nor equal cell counts establish equal spatial resolution or accuracy. The comparison therefore reports cell count and measured runtime separately, with numerical sensitivity assessed separately.

### 3.4. Numerical collection and staged loading

In the truncated model, the initial collector was prescribed to remove liquid at the inlet liquid mass-flow rate. Removal was distributed over a lower cell zone in proportion to local liquid volume fraction; a minimum denominator prevented division by near-zero liquid content. Vapour had no direct mass sink; accompanying momentum and turbulence sources represented removal with the liquid. This tested idealised collection and source delivery. Once the commanded removal was delivered, steady closure required negligible liquid discharge elsewhere. It was not a general physical drain law.

The later contact collector instead removed liquid according to local content:

$$S_L=-\chi\frac{\rho_L\alpha_L}{\tau},\qquad S_V=0,$$

where $\chi$ is one in collector cells and zero elsewhere, and $\tau$ is an assumed depletion time. In the truncated contact collector, “contact” meant entry to the existing 715-cell lower zone, selected by cell-centre height $y\leq0.10$ m. The selected startup configuration used $\tau=10^{-5}$ s. Matching momentum removal used liquid velocity; vapour had no direct sink. This finite-rate bulk capture did not empty the separate EWF store. Film initially left through its existing lower edge; the later direct film drain added a sink to a lower wall segment. A separate full-geometry collector used the same local-content form with different depletion times and domain definitions; Appendix G.1 retains that comparison.

Staged loading developed a 25%-feed field, increased both phase feeds over 2,000 iterations and then held full feed. A subsequent continuation changed pressure–velocity coupling to Coupled and enabled Global Time Step. Later startup comparisons activated Coupled, roughness, a contact collector and EWF before the inlet ramp. These tested a combined preparation procedure rather than isolating the effect of ramping alone. Cold-start tests that ramped the sink at full inlet flow were separate experiments.

### 3.5. Wall-film development and direct drainage

EWF introduced a separate wall-liquid inventory with film mass and momentum equations. DPM deposition and bulk-phase accretion provided different routes into that inventory. Splash, stripping and edge separation could release liquid, so their event counters, represented particle masses and film source terms required separate treatment. Roughness screens preceded combined roughness/film studies; the later selected roughness was 0.045 mm with roughness constant 0.5.

In the phase-accretion model, Eulerian liquid impinging on an enabled film wall feeds the film. The collection rate depends on liquid volume fraction, density, wall-normal phase velocity and face area; the secondary phase and film must use the same material. Fluent represents captured mass and momentum as removal from the bulk phase and addition to the film (Ansys, 2025b, §17.2.1.5). This transfer rule does not itself demonstrate numerical closure. In the 500 ms reference study, DPM collection was disabled, so the reported accretion came from the Eulerian liquid. During its frozen-bulk film advance, the fixed bulk field continued to supply film forcing without an evolving bulk inventory. Those film-source rates therefore could not establish whole-system conservation.

Film calculations included both active-bulk intervals and intervals with flow, turbulence, volume fraction and relative motion frozen. Freezing retained a fixed forcing field for film development; it did not establish that the carrier had converged. Film age means the accumulated time advanced by the film equations. It was recorded with the accepted timestep and the equations being updated. Where inner-film residuals were available, they were checked at each timestep; meeting that tolerance did not establish steady film inventory. Local film-balance checks with updating bulk flow were distinguished from checks made with bulk flow held fixed. The later mesh comparison selected frozen-bulk states at a common film age of 195 ms; available bulk-active extensions were assessed separately. The earlier coarse-mesh film history showed the drainage rate changing more slowly by about 200 ms (Figure 8), which informed the observation time. Those earlier film settings differed, so this choice did not imply equivalent development or equilibrium on every mesh. The selected-state analysis compared stored film and instantaneous removal rates; without continuous histories it could not supply late-window storage slopes or a complete film ledger.

The direct drain acted on a lower film-wall segment, using

$$s_m=-k\rho_L\max(h,0),\qquad \boldsymbol{s}_p=s_m\boldsymbol{u}_f,$$

where $s_m$ is the film mass source per unit wall area, $\boldsymbol{s}_p$ is the corresponding momentum source, and $h$ and $\boldsymbol{u}_f$ are film thickness and velocity. The capture time $\tau_f$ was 1.5 ms. The rate coefficient $k=\min(1/\tau_f,0.01/\Delta t_{\mathrm{refresh}})$ bounded source-only removal to at most 1% of local film mass over the declared 15 µs source-refresh span, $\Delta t_{\mathrm{refresh}}$. Transport and accretion could change the total film inventory independently of this removal bound. Tests with an initial film first compared depletion with the drain disabled and enabled while bulk flow was held fixed. Paired continuations then tested transport into an initially dry drain region. Film leaving through the model's existing outlet edges and film removed by the added source were integrated separately.

The later enhanced film configuration included gravity, gas shear, wall resistance, momentum advection, spreading and surface tension. It used sequential film equations and disabled Flow Momentum Coupling. Updating the bulk equations in that configuration therefore did not establish reciprocal film–bulk momentum coupling. Earlier coupled-film and basic-EWF configurations retained their own settings; they were not treated as equivalent models.

### 3.6. Droplet tracking and operating-condition comparisons

One-way DPM tracked droplets without feedback to the carrier. Interacting DPM calculations instead allocated part of the total liquid feed to particles and reduced Eulerian liquid feed correspondingly. Diagnostic one-way particle weights were not added as extra physical inlet mass. In the interacting cases, the continuous-phase interaction setting enabled particle momentum feedback to the bulk equations. The droplets were inert, with no evaporation; energy was not solved. A zero DPM mass source was therefore compatible with momentum interaction and did not mean that interaction was disabled. This particle–bulk coupling is distinct from the pressure–velocity solver setting named Coupled. The matched interacting-DPM cases with and without EWF used 2.5% of inlet liquid as droplets at nominal speeds of 20.11, 23.46, 26.81 and 32.14 m/s, plus a 5% case at 26.81 m/s. These five pairs varied speed and allocated droplet loading at the 1600 kJ/kg phase proportion; they were distinct from the five-enthalpy historical reconstruction below. They did not cover the entire proposed parameter matrix.

Historical enthalpy reconstruction used nine droplet-size groups from the recorded Harwell-derived distribution after 1,500 carrier iterations. Each group represented a prescribed diameter and mass-flow weight. Each of two historical inlet families contained five full-flow enthalpies, 1440–1760 kJ/kg, and a reduced-flow 1600 kJ/kg condition. The poly-hexcore reconstruction repeated the five full-flow conditions from fresh initial fields. Here, enthalpy identified prescribed phase feeds, injection speeds and droplet distributions; energy and phase change were not solved. Recovered liquid and vapour densities remained fixed at 881.2109 and 5.7974 kg/m$^{3}$, distinct from Table F.1. The 1,500-iteration horizon deliberately reproduced the historical procedure for an output-sensitivity comparison; it was not a convergence criterion. Appendix E specifies the nine-group diameters, weights, release surface and velocity prescription.

One-way tracking retained step-length factor 5, pressure and virtual-mass forces. The inlet and steam outlet were escape boundaries, the bottom trapped particles, and vessel walls reflected them with normal/tangential restitution coefficients 0.3/0.8. Aggregate escaped mass could therefore include inlet escape and was not necessarily steam-outlet carryover.

A tracking-budget test retracked the same frozen 1600 kJ/kg carrier solution on the poly-hexcore mesh at 10,000 and 100,000 maximum particle steps. The later comparisons used 100,000 steps. Their estimate

$$\eta_{\mathrm{assumed}}=100\left(1-\frac{\dot m_{\mathrm{escaped}}}{\dot m_{\mathrm{injected}}}\right)$$

counted incomplete trajectories as separated. Incomplete particles ended tracking without reaching an escape or trapping boundary; a trapped numerical fate was also not independently verified physical capture. All three categories were retained alongside the estimate. The historical provisional outlet-dryness estimate used inlet steam and recorded escaped mass; it was a distinct estimate, subject to the same need to identify the escape boundary.

## 4. Verification and validation assessment

The numerical assessment connected each modelling advance to evidence of its operation and to the comparisons it could support. It separated three questions: was the intended calculation implemented, was its numerical solution sufficiently settled and conservative, and did it reproduce physical separator behaviour? Configuration checks and simple analytical tests addressed the first question. Residual, mass-balance, inventory and sensitivity checks addressed the second. Independent measurements would be required for the third.

### 4.1. Implementation and numerical controls

Reading back solver settings, checking the mesh and reopening selected saved solutions verified that the intended configuration and results had been retained. Python and PyFluent supported setup and extraction. Solver transcripts supplied iteration numbers when interface counters were stale. Source fields already expressed as per-cell mass flow were summed, rather than multiplied by cell volume again.

Solver settings and their numerical time interpretation were retained separately for each comparison. Global Time Step in the steady calculations was numerical pseudo-time, not elapsed physical time. Appendix F gives the full-geometry solver controls and the independent analytical check of the outlet-resistance law. Those component tests did not establish multiphase separator hydraulics.

### 4.2. Mass accounting, film transfer and storage

Boundary fluxes were positive into the domain. For an EWF-off liquid calculation, the steady remainder was

$$R_L=\sum_b\dot m_{L,b}+\dot m_{L,\mathrm{source}},\qquad M_L=\int_V\rho_L\alpha_L\,\mathrm dV.$$

Removal sources were negative and counted once. Solver reports that already included sources were distinguished from boundary-only reports. Liquid, vapour and solver-reported mixture balances were normalised by their corresponding feeds. Mean absolute error used the mean of absolute sample remainders, not the absolute signed mean. Where DPM or film transfer was active, its signed contribution belonged in the relevant subsystem account.

For physical transient flow, the storage-aware remainder was

$$R_{L,\mathrm{transient}}=\sum_b\dot m_{L,b}+\dot m_{L,\mathrm{source}}-\frac{\Delta M_L}{\Delta t},$$

with any active inter-model transfers included. Steady inventory change per iteration remained a numerical-development measure. It was not divided by an EWF timestep to invent a physical bulk storage rate.

The local film mass balance compared measured inventory change with integrated transfers over the film-time interval:

$$E_f=\Delta M_f-\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\left(\dot m_{\mathrm{to\ film,net}}-\dot m_{\mathrm{film,out}}-\dot m_{\mathrm{direct\ drain}}\right)\,\mathrm dt.$$

The net source was the film mass gained after any release already included in the solver report. Release was therefore subtracted separately only when it had not already been included. Error normalisation followed the declared integrated source or transfer basis. This accounting allowed a growing film to conserve mass; stationary film additionally required negligible storage.

For the combined bulk, film and particle system, internal transfers must cancel. A film-only balance could not establish conservation of the combined system when bulk flow was held fixed. A local film pass with bulk flow updating also left the other mass balances to be checked. Film removal, collector removal and particle boundary fates were kept distinct.

### 4.3. Convergence, comparison windows and uncertainty

Assessment combined residuals, conservation, storage and routing. Appendix B gives the numerical criteria and windows for the principal tests; these were study tolerances, not estimates of physical uncertainty. It also defines the pressure averaging surfaces and weights, which differed between model families, and the historical pressure-drift calculation. Reaching an iteration count or film age was a separate execution outcome. Some later EWF runs continued after numerical acceptance limits ceased to control continuation, so completion did not mean those limits had been met. Table 2 summarises the interpretation checks.

| **Check** | **Assessment** | **Interpretation limit** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Bulk solution | Active residuals, phase/source balances, inventory and wrong-outlet flow | A small scaled residual alone did not establish steady conservation |
| Film solution | Inner-film tolerance, Courant, thickness, source integration and storage | A local balance pass did not establish stationary or complete-system flow |
| Mesh comparison | Between-mesh changes versus within-run drift and spatial differences | Equal iteration count or film age did not ensure equal numerical maturity |
| Particle tracking | Fate-mass reconciliation and sensitivity to tracking budget | Accounting for incomplete mass did not determine its eventual destination |

*Table 2. Numerical checks and their interpretation boundaries.*

Mesh comparison used cell counts, boundary identities and available quality metrics. Pressure, velocity and inventory histories tested iterative stability before a spatial-discretisation claim. Matched wall resolution was not established. For field comparisons, cell velocities were volume-averaged into $20\times70\times20$ common bins. Each shared bin was weighted by the smaller volume assigned by the two meshes. The resulting root-mean-square (RMS) vector difference was normalised by reference RMS velocity. Cross-mesh coverage was 86–91% of reference volume, compared with 100% for same-mesh iteration comparisons. A coarser $10\times35\times10$ projection retained the qualitative conclusion. These were comparisons over supported bins, not whole-domain discretisation-error estimates. No Grid Convergence Index was inferred from unstable sequences. Runtime comparisons measured cost for the stated cases, not time to equivalent accuracy.

### 4.4. Validation basis

The Purnanto study supplied the model reconstruction reference. The later enthalpy comparison used the project's July tetrahedral results, with software provenance described in Appendix G.4. The exact July case binary and tracking cap were not recovered, so agreement tested reproduction of recorded estimates rather than exact replication. Matched measurements of carryover, brine discharge and pressure loss, with compatible definitions and uncertainty, were unavailable. Implementation checks and numerical sensitivity were therefore assessed separately from physical accuracy.
