## Abstract

Geothermal steam-water separators must remove liquid efficiently while preventing its re-entrainment into the steam stream. To investigate liquid transport within a separator and support design improvements, this study extended an existing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The original model lacked a dedicated liquid discharge pathway and did not explicitly represent wall-film behaviour. To overcome these limitations, modifications to the inlet conditions, mesh resolution, and startup procedure were combined with the implementation of liquid removal and wall-film modelling, thereby enabling detailed examination of these processes.

Liquid-distribution results revealed flow features near the separator wall that were not evident from outlet flow rates alone. In the absence of a liquid collection pathway, liquid continued to accumulate within the separator, demonstrating that low liquid carryover through the steam outlet does not necessarily indicate effective separation. Introducing liquid removal and initially reducing the inlet flow rate reduced the reported scaled continuity residual by approximately a factor of 650 and decreased the retained liquid inventory by about 93% relative to an earlier case without liquid removal. Although direct comparison is complicated by differences in scaling, inlet flow conditions, and mesh resolution, the lower residual levels and minimal variation in inventory during the reduced-flow period provided a stable basis for investigating wall roughness, film transport, and drainage behaviour.

With the surrounding flow field held constant, wall-film evolution was simulated for 500 ms. During this period, the liquid film spread over a large portion of the separator wall. Although drainage rates approached a quasi-steady state, the total liquid inventory continued to increase. Removal of film near the separator base reduced local accumulation; however, liquid continued to collect in upper wall regions. Simulations using finer meshes produced more distinct drainage pathways, lower liquid inventories, and reduced drainage rates, indicating that the influence of mesh resolution remains unresolved.

These findings informed two design concepts aimed at improving liquid collection: a vertical barrier to interrupt the recirculation of wall liquid and an inclined ramp to direct liquid downward toward the collection zone. While the predicted flow patterns indicated favourable local changes, enhanced liquid collection has not yet been demonstrated. The duration of the simulations was constrained by computational cost; however, the upgraded model now provides a platform for more detailed investigation of liquid transport and collection processes. Future work should determine whether wall-film accumulation eventually reaches equilibrium and whether the proposed design modifications improve drainage performance. Before the model can be used confidently to predict separator performance, a complete liquid mass balance and validation against experimental measurements are required.

## Declaration

**Student**

I hereby declare that:

1. This report is the result of the final year project work carried out by my project partner (see cover page) and I under the guidance of our supervisor (see cover page) in the 2026 academic year at the Department Engineering Science and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Auckland.
2. This report is not the outcome of work done previously.
3. This report is not the outcome of work done in collaboration, except that with a potential project sponsor (if any) as stated in the text.
4. This report is not the same as any report, thesis, conference article or journal paper, or any other publication or unpublished work in any format.

**Continuing-project statement.** The work builds on an inherited separator model and the published work of Purnanto et al. (2013). The present investigation developed liquid-collection and startup procedures, examined mesh and inlet assumptions, and studied wall roughness, film transport, release and drainage. The starting geometry and bulk modelling approach are identified as inherited work.

**Use of generative AI.** OpenAI Codex assisted with literature retrieval, coding and checking Fluent/PyFluent workflows, execution and recovery support, analysis, figure preparation and report drafting. Fluent performed the numerical calculations. I directed the scientific scope and supplied the physical interpretation.

**Contribution statement.** This report presents my simplified-domain inlet, mesh, liquid-removal, startup and wall-film investigations. Andy Tran carried out the separate replication and full-geometry numerical investigations. The total of 387 executed configurations in Section 4.12 covers both partners; it is not a count of my work alone. Supervisor discussions helped shape the research direction and wall-liquid design concepts.
